# Chatroom_Client_Server_Application
The main objective of the Chatroom project is to create a chat application which helps different users to
communicate with each other through a server connected using Python programming. This is a simple
chat program with a server and can have many clients. The Chat room application provides bidirectional
communication between client and server. It enables users to seamlessly communicate with each other.
The user has an option to login to the chat room, should be able to provide the IP address of the server
and the port to which he is connecting. The user can chat using this chat application. The server shall
poll other users that are active in the chat room and make those users visible. If the user at the other
end is active, then they can start a chat session. The chat is recorded in the application. The user can
save the chat transcript or clear it based on his requirement.
